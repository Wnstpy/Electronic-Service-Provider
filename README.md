                        Electronic Service Provider
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a electronic service provider for registered or new users to purchase services
provided by the "Winston ESP". It also allowed for admins to perform administrative 
functions to maintain the smooth running of the ESP. This was designed for my course for Year 1
Sem 2 of Poly.
